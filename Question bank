DOCKER QUESTION REAL TIME INTERVIEW 

@. Entrypoint and cmd difference
@. if we give one entry point to a dockerfile still will you able to change that entry point at a run time ?
@. then other question is suppose can we write two from statememt in docker file if yes how we can acheive that and what will happen?

Scenaraio based Question : 
@. Suppose yesterday we have pull one image from production on the server and in your remote local server you have already push that image.
and today lets say if the image got deleted from production and your docker pull command is also not working .
How will you verify the image is same ?

Answer : 
docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' <image-name>     #### shaid ######
answer and learn about it in more detail

@. how to increase the log level of docker running container ?
Answer : 
docker update --log-driver=json-file --log-opt max-size=10m --log-opt max-file=3 --log-opt labels=debug-level=debug <container-id-or-name>
